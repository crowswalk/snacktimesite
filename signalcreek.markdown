# [BUY IT ON STEAM!](https://steam.snacktimegamestudio.com)

We made this freaking thing in Godot 3.5 Mono! It's got pixel art, an abandoned mall, and some talking apples. Let's just say this is some awesome copywriting, the better copy is totally not on our Steam page, this totally isnt being written on one of the studio owners' phones right now.

Highlighting the glamor of being ultra indie and DIY... NOBODY PAID US! (except for the nice people at Graffiti Games and Turbo who paid for our tables at PlayNYC. Shout out.)

ALSO THE SCREENSHOTS ARE OUTDATED... Use em from STEAM! Or CONTACT US FOR BETTER ONES! (The fancy-shmancy art is more fancy-shmancy than those on this page)
