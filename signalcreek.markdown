Nour, a 22 year-old college student, sneaks into the soon-to-be demolished Signal Creek mall. She quickly finds herself trapped with Nick, her little brother’s best friend, and Ms. Suwan, her professional mentor. In order to escape the dreamlike reality of the mall, Nour must guide everyone—including herself—through a journey of reconciliation.

Signal Creek started as a year-long project designed from recent NYU graduates. Release is currently set for 2024!

Signal Creek explores the psyche of protagonist Nour through a dynamic dialogue system, a robust cast of special NPCs, three explorable rooms, beautiful pixel art assets, and original music.
