# Signal Creek

...is a story-rich pixel art JRPG with elements of fantasy-realism, LGBTQ+ identities, and vibrant choice-based dialogue.

## Synopsis

Nour, a 22 year-old college student, sneaks into the soon-to-be demolished Signal Creek mall, but quickly finds herself trapped with her little brother’s best friend, Nick, and her professional mentor, Ms. Suwan. In order to escape the dreamlike reality of the mall, Nour must guide everyone—including herself—through a journey of reconciliation.

## Background

Signal Creek is a year-long project designed by recent graduates of the NYU Game Center. We're working on a more polished 
version of the current game, which is set to release in 2024.

We're looking to expand our audience reach before we continue the story. If you want to see more of Signal Creek, please download the first game on itch.io to show your support!

Signal Creek explores the psyche of protagonist Nour through a dynamic dialogue system, a robust cast of special NPCs, three explorable rooms, beautiful pixel art assets, and original music.
